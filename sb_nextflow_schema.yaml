  Introduction\n\n**nfcore/atacseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for
  ATAC-seq data.\n\nThe pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io),
  a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable
  manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results
  highly reproducible.\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\n1. Raw read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))\n2.

  [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/))\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)\n\n2.
  Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)
  for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
  as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_\n\n3.
  Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:\n\n
  \   ```bash\n    nextflow run nf-core/atacseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>\n
  \   ```\n\n    > Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation)
  to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your
  Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This
  will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings
  for your local compute environment.\n\n4. Start running your own analysis!\n\n    ```bash\n
  \   nextflow run nf-core/atacseq -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input
  design.csv --genome GRCh37\n    ```\n\nSee [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of
  the available options when running the pipeline.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe nf-core/atacseq
  pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:\n\n1.
